Keep a sheet separate to the data linking Study IDs to patient IDs 1.4.2 Numeric Data Enter continuous data, such as Age or Weight as a single numeric field without any extra text (ie enter 50 instead of 50kg) Do not enter two variables for the same piece of information (ie Age and Age Category). Instead, enter age and specify AgeCat as a calculated variable, or in your statistical analysis plan. Entering data once reduces the amount of data entry and the potential for errors. 1.4.3 Categorical Data Enter the Levels of categorical and code variables in the order you would like them presented (ie CR=complete recovery, PR=partial recovery,SD=stable disease,PD=progressive disease) Categorical data can be entered as numbers, letters or abbreviations instead of text Categories are entered separate by commas Example: T1,T2,T3,T4 Codes are entered in the data dictionary in the format code=label separated by commas Examples: 1=Female, 2=Male CR= Complete Recovery, PR= Partial Recovery, SD = Stable Disease, PD = Progressive Disease 1.4.4 Dates Should be entered in the unambiguous format “01-Jan-2020” to avoid confusion Dates after the current date will be highlighted in red as a warning "],["variable-ranges.html", "1.5 Variable Ranges", " 1.5 Variable Ranges - All date, integer and numeric values should have ranges specified. These should correspond to inclusion and exclusion criteria for your study, or natural values the variable can take. If you don’t know the upper limit (ie of a biomarker), then put in the maximum reasonable value. Values above this will be flagged and you can adjust the maximum to include them if you wish. The Minimum and Maximum can be: values (ie 40) variables names (if you want the minimum date of death to be DxDate for example) for date variables you can enter today to allow all dates up to the date of data entry for all other dates use the format 1-Jan-2023 to avoid ambiguity "],["calculations.html", "1.6 Calculations", " 1.6 Calculations All calculations can be performed by the Biostatistics department. These will be done in code and are easily reproduced and re-calculated if there are changes to the data. This saves time and increases data quality. Examples of some variables that can be easily calculated: Age (from Date of Birth and Assessment Date) Overall Survival (from Date of Diagnosis and Date of Death) Survival Status (from Date of Death and Last Follow-up) Age or BMI categories from raw data Do not do calculations in Excel. Instead, specify re-codings and calculations in the data dictionary. Your can specify syntax to automatically create re-coded variables (these will not appear in your data entry sheet) 1.6.1 Recoded Variables Recoded variables are calculated from categorical or coded variables (as opposed to categorising a numerical variable) Syntax: OrginalVar,newCode1=oldCode1,oldCode2,newCode2=oldCode3,oldCode4 where OriginalVar is the variable in the data to be recoded and newCodes=oldCodes gives the new category followed by comma-separated original categories. Example of recoding a variable in the Data Dictionary: Example of a recoded variable This will create the T0_Stg variable from T_Stage. T0_Stg will be T0 if T_Stage is T0 and T1up for all other values of T_Stage. 1.6.2 Categorised Variables Categorised variables are created from continuous variables Syntax: OrginalVar,category1=&lt;cutoff1,category2=&lt;cutoff2,category3 where OriginalVar is the variable in the data to be categorised and category1,category2 etc are the names of the new categories (these will become factor levels) and cutoff1,cutoff2 are the cut-offs for each category and the final category (in this case category3) does not have a cutoff, only a name, because all people not meeting earlier criteria will be in this level. Note that at this point it is only possible to create categories by specifying the upper bounds. Example of categorising a continuous variable in the Data Dictionary: This will create the AgeGroup variable from Age with four levels: “under50’,‘50-60’,‘60-69’,‘70plus’ "],["entering-data.html", "1.7 Entering Data", " 1.7 Entering Data Enter Data into the DataEntry sheet created by the DataDictionary Leave missing data blank Do not add additional header rows Do not store information for biostatistics in cell formatting or comments - these are not imported Hidden rows and columns are not hidden from statistical software, remove these before sending Do not add pivot tables, summary statistics or graphs to the DataEntry sheet.

This makes data checking and cleaning simpler, and reduces the size of your data dictionary because there are fewer variables. Example of data in long format. There is one entry for each observation Static variables, like sex and age, or variables that were collected at a single time point can be entered in a separate sheet. 1.8.2 Wide Format If data are entered in wide format, with one row per patient then the variable names should be consistent across the time points, as shown below. ⚠️ All variable names must be unique!

Each person is in a row and each assessment has a group of columns "],["multiple-data-sheets.html", "1.9 Multiple Data Sheets", " 1.9 Multiple Data Sheets You can have as many data entry sheets as you need. This is a good idea for longitudinal studies where you may have one sheet with static patient information (age, sex, ethnicity) and another sheet for different assessments, especially if some patients are assessed more frequently than others and creating a column for each assessment is difficult.

"],["frequently-asked-questions.html", "1.11 Frequently Asked Questions", " 1.11 Frequently Asked Questions My data is already in an Excel list from an online capture system, do I still need to enter the specifications? Yes, but this should be a quick process. The reason that we need the specifications is to know how the data should look so that we can check for inconsistencies before analysing the data. Also, to know the appropriate ordering for the data. When the data is imported, a variable with levels such as 0-2 years, 3-5 years, 5-10 years and 10+ years can’t be ordered correctly without a specification. You can use the UNIQUE function in Excel to extract all the unique values from a column (ie =UNIQUE(A2:A50) to get the unique values in column A up to row 50). I have a lot of variables and I don’t want to enter specifications for all of them! It is essential to provide specification for all the variables you send to Biostatistics, but here are some tips to help: 1. Include only the variables you would like analysed in your DataDictionary. 1. If you still have a lot of variables, it is likely that a number of them will have the same type and range, so you can copy and paste those to save time. 1. If you have a lot of variables with spaces or special characters, place the original variable name in the description field, and give your variables simple names - these can be as simple as q1, q2, etc (you don’t need to type those, Excel will allow you to highlight a few and then drag down automatically renaming to q3, q4 etc).
